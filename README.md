Linear Regression Model for Real Estate Pricing

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict real estate prices based on square footage. The model is built using Python and libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The dataset is read from an Excel file, and the project demonstrates the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Features
Data Handling: Reads data from an Excel file using pandas.
Machine Learning: Implements a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Data Visualization: Visualizes the relationship between square footage and price using matplotlib.
Evaluation: Calculates and displays the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Workflow
Data Loading: Import real estate data from an Excel file, including features like "Square Footage" and "Price."
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict prices for the testing dataset.
Evaluation: Measure the model's accuracy with Mean Squared Error.
Visualization: Display a scatter plot and regression line to illustrate the model's fit.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
How to Use
Place your dataset in an Excel file (e.g., data.xlsx) with columns Square Footage and Price.
Update the file path in the script to match your dataset location:
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_excel('path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx')
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
View the Mean Squared Error and a plot of the regression model.
Results
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is printed in the console to evaluate the model.
A graph is displayed showing the data points and the regression line.
